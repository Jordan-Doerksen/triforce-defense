# Changelog

Phase log for triforce-defense. Newest first. Group by chunk/milestone; keep entries
concrete (what changed, what it proves), with absolute dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
Mirrors the Build Timeline in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Unreleased
- …

## 2026-10-15 — Under the kit (design-first 0.1.38)
- Every colour and font of the brief moves to `design/deck_vellum_tokens.css` (GAME-07): the stylesheet's, and the sky canvas's two colours, which `brief.js` now reads from it. `deck_vellum_ds.css` and `brief.js` hold none, except the paper mottling tint inside a data-URI filter, which a variable cannot reach. Plate I under reduced motion screenshots byte-identical before and after the move (headless Chrome, compared with `cmp`).
- Reduced motion now also stops smooth scrolling, the seal, button and rail transitions, and the sky's frame loop (one still frame) (SAFE-05).
- `.gitattributes` added (DES-09; late — the first commit did not carry it).
- `design/brief.js`: the one empty catch carries its reason (OBS-04).
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` ends with `## Next session` (DES-14).
- Stale split-by-size text in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `core/README.md` replaced by DES-03. README pointer and licence line corrected. Council record line 3 corrected.

## 2026-10-15 — The brief and council session 1
- Council session 1, run by hand in chat: manifest chapters 1–3 (`records/council-2026-10-15-shape.md`). Decision 2.6, building roles.
- Deck slide 01, then the living brief `design/index.html` on `deck_vellum_ds`: cover, rail, Plate I. Terms amended (towns, captains, the King's army). Decision 1.5, the three towns, then its amendment after Plate I's sketch.
- Hand-off written for the next session.

## 2026-10-15 — Chunk 1: skeleton
- Initial scaffold: domain-split repo, docs (ARCHITECTURE + DECISIONS manifest + SPEC + HANDOFF), per-domain config .json, .gitignore, license.
