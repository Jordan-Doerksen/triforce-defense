## 2026-10-15 — Plate I map accuracy pass (Decision 1.5 amendment)
- The map is redrawn: a winding river out of the north, through the hill town, over the falls and into the valley's lake; the towns smaller and farther apart; the hill↔valley road runs down beside the falls and crosses the river at a bridge; a mountain ridge down the whole west border; a thick forest down the whole east, around the forest town. Neatline, and a bridge entry in the legend.
- Animations kept (blight, river flow, falls, lake glint, night waves); no new motion. The falls get a water bed so they read. Map colours are tokens; the map's inline colours moved to classes.
- Map probe, headless Chrome, 2026-10-15: no label overlaps another, crosses a town wall or runs off its road; the river ends inside the lake; the hill road crosses the river once, with the bridge on the crossing; each short road starts in the overrun province and ends at a gate; ridge and forest span the frame. Result `ok: true`; the same probe returned `ok: false` on a copy with the river cut short and a short road moved out of the wild. The probe is session scratch, not in the repo. Two read-only reviewers found the river short of the lake, an "only way" line that contradicted the short road, a short road outside the wild and borders short of the frame; all four fixed.
- Body text: the falls road is "the safe road" to the valley, not "the only way" — the short road through the north was always the other way.
- Screenshot `design/shots/plate-1.png`. Called accurate by the owner on 2026-10-16.
- 2026-10-16: the repo is pushed and made public on the owner's word, so a cloud session can open it.

## 2026-10-15 — Under the kit (design-first 0.1.38)
- Every colour and font of the brief moves to `design/deck_vellum_tokens.css` (GAME-07): the stylesheet's, and the sky canvas's two colours, which `brief.js` now reads from it. `deck_vellum_ds.css` and `brief.js` hold none, except the paper mottling tint inside a data-URI filter, which a variable cannot reach. Plate I under reduced motion screenshots byte-identical before and after the move (headless Chrome, compared with `cmp`).
- Reduced motion now also stops smooth scrolling, the seal, button and rail transitions, and the sky's frame loop (one still frame) (SAFE-05).
- `.gitattributes` added (DES-09; late — the first commit did not carry it).
- `design/brief.js`: the one empty catch carries its reason (OBS-04).
- `docs/HANDOFF.md` ends with `## Next session` (DES-14).
- Stale split-by-size text in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `core/README.md` replaced by DES-03. README pointer and licence line corrected. Council record line 3 corrected.

## 2026-10-15 — The brief and council session 1
- Council session 1, run by hand in chat: manifest chapters 1–3 (`records/council-2026-10-15-shape.md`). Decision 2.6, building roles.
- Deck slide 01, then the living brief `design/index.html` on `deck_vellum_ds`: cover, rail, Plate I. Terms amended (towns, captains, the King's army). Decision 1.5, the three towns, then its amendment after Plate I's sketch.
- Hand-off written for the next session.

## 2026-10-15 — Chunk 1: skeleton
- Initial scaffold: domain-split repo, docs (ARCHITECTURE + DECISIONS manifest + SPEC + HANDOFF), per-domain config .json, .gitignore, license.
